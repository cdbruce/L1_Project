# L1_Project
This repository contains the L1 datasets used in the study, code and processed data for the paper in revision "Human L1 Transposition Dynamics Unraveled with Functional Data Analysis"

## The study is broadly separated into three major parts
1. Genome-wide visualization and distance analysis of the three L1 datasets (de novo L1s, polymorphic L1s, and human-specific L1s) included in the study
2. Comparison of genomic landscape features related to L1 insertion and fixation via Interval-Wise Testing for Omics Data (IWTomics) 
3. Quantification of contribution from individual genomic features and their joint effect using Functional Logistic Regression (FLR) 

## Folders
Datasets: Genomic coordinates of elements from the three L1 datasets, their 100-kb flanking regions, and a control set
Analysis: Contains analysis scripts and processed RData objects used to generate results
