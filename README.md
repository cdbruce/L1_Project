Human L1 Transposition Dynamics Unraveled with Functional Data Analysis
This repository contains the L1 datasets used in the study, code and processed data for the Functional Data Analysis (FDA) workflow.

## The analysis is broadly separated into three major parts:
1. Genome-wide visualization and distance analysis of the de novo L1s, polymorphic L1s, and human-specific L1s included in the study.
2. Comparison of genomic landscape features related to L1 insertion and fixation via Interval-Wise Testing for Omics Data (IWTomics). 
3. Quantification of contribution from individual genomic features and their joint effect using Functional Logistic Regression (FLR). 

## Folders
Datasets: contains all of the analysis scripts used to generate main figures of the paper
